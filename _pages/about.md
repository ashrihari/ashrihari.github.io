Hey, I'm a second year master's student at CMU. I am currently interested in building robust locomotion navigation policies for robots in real world scenarios, I am currently working on building a locomotoin policy for a bipedal wheeled robot. My past work includes building high performance on device vision systems for error detection on factories and assembly lines.
